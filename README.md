Content in this application is a proof of concept of information leakage from UMS webservice. I will not be held responsible for any harm done using information gathered from this webservice/application. This application is only and only for educational purpose.
Read [Terms Of Service](https://github.com/its-arun/Mini-UMS-App/wiki/Terms-of-Service) before using this application.

## About
This application is made to show basic information of any student in Lovely Professional University using a flaw that I found in UMS Webservice. UMS is University Management System which is developed in house by Lovely Infotech for Lovely Professional University. This application is not affliated or associated with Lovely Infotech. As this application is webview based so it's highlt unlikely that this repository would update as all the changes will be made in the back-end. This repository will only update if `Android 8` comes or if I decide to improve app interface and add more activities.
